Also I kinda want to draw Yasker from Allods Online because I like his design. It's a pity I don't know who is the leader of the opposite faction, guess they were not hot enough for me to remember that ðŸ˜†

Edit: I just looked it up and the leader of the opposite faction sorta looks like yellow-purple version of Ice King from Adventure Time hmm...

Edit 2: See my point?
