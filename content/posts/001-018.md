Sometimes I play games for silly reasons. For an instance, I once misread one game's name as "Champions of Rectum" and forgot about it for months. Then suddenly I had a flashback of seeing an ad of it and I was like "Wait... Why would they name their game like that???" So I googled it and I decided to download it while I was there. The game was kinda buggy, but also sorta nice. It had some charm to it. Unfortunately they wiped all my progress when I was away during a server merge. Guess I was never meant to be a champion after all...

Oh, and btw the game's name is actually Champions of Regnum. You can Google it, but the game has some pretty creepy goblin people as a playable race, don't say I didn't warn you!
