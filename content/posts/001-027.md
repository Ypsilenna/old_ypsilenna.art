I had a dream today that I really really wanted to have my own art discord again full of activities and fun stuff. I named it Song of Creation, but in that dream I never actually made it because I just wanted to go buy some food in a shop and I got lost in it ðŸ˜‚
I don't know if it's a sign to make it or not make it..
